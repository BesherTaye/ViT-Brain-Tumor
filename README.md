# Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging: Brain Tumor Classification



In this project, we will investigate the effectiveness of Vision Transformers (ViT) in tackling challenging problem of medical imaging using the Brain Tumor dataset. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long been the standard for computer vision tasks, ViT offers a novel approach by leveraging self-attention mechanisms derived from the Transformer architecture, which was initially developed for natural language processing.
